# Ladybug

A Zig implementation of a lightning-fast ASGI server, inspired by uvicorn.

This project aims to rewrite the popular Python ASGI server [uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn) in Zig, taking advantage of Zig's performance characteristics and safety guarantees. The development approach is exploratory and iterative, focusing on understanding and reimplementing uvicorn's core functionality while maintaining its speed and reliability.

## Status

This is a work in progress. The project is being developed through "vibe coding" - an intuitive, exploratory approach to understanding and reimplementing uvicorn's architecture and features.

## Goals

- Provide a high-performance ASGI server implementation in Zig
- Maintain compatibility with ASGI specification
- Learn and document the process of porting Python async code to Zig
- Explore Zig's concurrency and networking capabilities

## Current Features

- Basic HTTP server implementation
- More features coming soon!
